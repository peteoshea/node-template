# Node.js Template

A template repository for a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) project.
This includes scripts to get a development system setup on Windows, Linux or hopefully MacOS.

The version of Node.js can be specified in [.nvmrc](.nvmrc) but be aware that due to restrictions with [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) this needs to be the full version number e.g. 14.5.0 or v12.8.2.

##  Windows Development

The following scripts will help you maintain your local development system.

### [powershell/setup](powershell/setup.ps1)

Used to set up a project in an initial state.
This is typically run after an initial clone, or, to reset the project back to its initial state.

### [powershell/update](powershell/update.ps1)

Used to update the project after a fresh pull.
This should include any database migrations or any other things required to get the
state of the app into shape for the current version that is checked out.

The following scripts are for use on a Linux based system, including MacOS or even Windows Subsystem for Linux.
